                <p class="pyaedu">Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist who has become a global symbol for the advocacy of girls’ education.
                     Born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora, Pakistan, Malala’s passion for learning was evident from a young age. 
                     Her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, ran a learning institution and instilled in her the value of education.
                      However, when the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley, they imposed a ban on girls’ education, which Malala bravely defied.
                     She began blogging anonymously for the BBC at the age of 11, sharing her experiences and desire to learn. Her activism garnered international attention, but also made her a target of the Taliban. In 2012, she survived an assassination attempt and continued her mission with even greater resolve. Malala’s courage and dedication to education rights led to her becoming the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate in 2014. 
                    She pursued higher education at the University of Oxford, studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics.</p>
