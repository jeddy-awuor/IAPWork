            <h1 id="Bio">Malala's Stories</h1>
            <p class="pyaedu">When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education.

                On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive. 
                
                Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize.
                
                "I AM MALALA" is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.
                
                "I AM MALALA" will make you believe in the power of one person's voice to inspire change in the world.</p>

                <h3 class="education">Malala Day</h3>
                <p class="pyaedu">On 12 July 2013, Yousafzai's 16th birthday, she spoke at the UN to call for worldwide access to education. The UN dubbed the event "Malala Day".[127] Yousafzai wore one of Benazir Bhutto's shawls to the UN. It was her first public speech since the attack,[147] leading the first ever Youth Takeover of the UN, with an audience of over 500 young education advocates from around the world.[148]

                    The terrorists thought they would change my aims and stop my ambitions, but nothing changed in my life except this: weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born ... I am not against anyone, neither am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist group. I'm here to speak up for the right of education for every child. I want education for the sons and daughters of the Taliban and all terrorists and extremists.[147]
                    
                    Yousafzai received several standing ovations. Ban Ki-moon, who also spoke at the session, described her as "our hero".[127] Yousafzai also presented the chamber with "The Education We Want",[149] a Youth Resolution of education demands written by Youth for Youth, in a process co-ordinated by the UN Global Education First Youth Advocacy Group,[150] telling her audience:
                    
                    Malala day is not my day. Today is the day of every woman, every boy and every girl who have raised their voice for their rights.[151]
                    
                    The Pakistani government did not comment on Yousafzai's UN appearance, amid a backlash against her in Pakistan's press and social media.[152][153]
                    
                    Words from the speech were used as lyrics for "Speak Out", a song by Kate Whitley commissioned by BBC Radio 3 and broadcast on International Women's Day 2017</p>
